Ramus execpted recieve: 
(We compare to multiple good recording)

WE WILL AVERAGE SAMPLE RECORDING UP FOR AN OVERALL SAMPLE RECORDING

Good_recording: [{notevalue:int(hz), duration:int(s), volumn:int(0~1), ...}]
User_recording: [{notevalue:int(hz), duration:int(s), volumn:int(0~1), ...}]

Rating will be = factor1*abs(good_recording[index][notevalue]-user_recording[index][notevalue]) + factor2*abs(good_recording[index][duration]-user_recording[index][duration]) + ... 
      + factorsomething*abs(user_recording[index][duration]-user_recording[index-1][duration]) + factoranotherthing*abs(user_recording[index][duration]-user_recording[index-2][duration])+ ...


Concerns about rubato:

Check if the tempo is decreasing / increasing in sequence


Next step: learn reinforcement learning
